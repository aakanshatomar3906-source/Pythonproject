Personal Expense Tracker 

Project Description  
The Personal Expense Tracker is a command-line Python application that helps users record, categorize, and summarize their personal expenses. It uses a plain text file, expenses.txt, for storage, so your data is saved and preserved between sessions.  

Features  
Add Expense: Record expenses with a category, amount, and date.  

View Expenses: Show all expenses organized by category.   

Monthly Summary: Check total and per-category spending for any month and year you choose.  

Persistent Storage: All expenses are stored in a file, expenses.txt, for later access.  

Input Validation: Ensures the correct format for amounts and dates, and handles invalid input smoothly.

Save the source code, for example, as expense_tracker.py, in a directory.
